# Climate_Change_Projects

#### Initial_project.py
A set of data projects related to the theme of climate change. It will look at data on climate change and analyse them to find trends and patterns.

1. initial_project.py will look at CO2 emission data from across the world. This will include the average CO2 emission
temporally across a certain time period, the amount of CO2 emission contributed to by fossil feuls and also fossil fuels
by country. Full write up with analysis: https://mukhiasafal740.medium.com/how-to-get-started-on-a-data-project-a-simple-example-de07f26738f3

The datasets used for this analysis were co2-mm-mlo_csv, fossil-fuel-co2-emissions-by-nation_csv and global_csv.

#### Temperature_vs_emissions.py

This script merged the separate data sets from CO2 emssisions and Global Temperatures measured by NASA (GISTEMP and GCAP) to look at their correlations. 
The output can be viewed in temp_vs_emissions.png file. The pearson_correlation shown on the graphs was 0.95, indicating (if the temperature and emissions data is not noisy) that there is a very strong correlation between an increase of temperature with emissions.
